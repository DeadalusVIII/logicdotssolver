# Logic Dots Solver
A puzzle solver for the popular Logic Dots mobile game.

[Logic Dots](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.ayopagames.logicdotsandroid) is a popular game for IOS and Android platforms, developed by [Ayopagames](http://www.ayopagames.com/), which consists in placing a certain amount of dots in a grid according to a set of restrictions. Having reached a point where the game was no longer fun due to its complexity, I decided to move on to the next step and develop an automatic solver of Logic Dots puzzles, just for the extra fun.

At this moment the solver is already capable of finding a solution for the given puzzles, when loaded from a txt file. In the future, I intend to introduce a mobile extension, combined with image processing algorithms and direct mobile input to directly extract the puzzle from the mobile game, solve it and then type back the solution to the game, without any human interaction!
